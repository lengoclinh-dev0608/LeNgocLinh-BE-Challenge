# Basic API 

This is a boilerplate for an Express based API written in Typescript.
I utilize an in-memory SQLite database for ease of use, eliminating the need for deployment. Additionally, please note that since it resides in memory, the database will be deleted each time it is run.
Simply clone this repository and run.

```bash
npm install
```

You can use nodemon or ts-node to run a development server.  Install them globally first:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon ts-node typescript
```

Then, run:

```bash
nodemon 
```
